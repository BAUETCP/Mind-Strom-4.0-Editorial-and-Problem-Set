<h3>A. Bauet Day </h3>
<p>
The problem was set by <a href="https://github.com/mdarikrayhan">Md. Arik Rayhan</a>. This was a giveway problem, you just need to print two birthday in given format according to their year.Solution link: <a href="https://github.com/mdarikrayhan/Mind-Strom-4.0-Editorial-and-Problem-Set/tree/main/Solution/1.Bauet%20Day">A.

<h3>B.Beautiful Prime(Easy Version)</h3>
<p>
The problem was set by <a href="https://github.com/mdarikrayhan">Md. Arik Rayhan</a>. This was also a giveway problem, Here the task is to print the prime<sup>th</sup> prime number. Example if n=3 then first 3 prime numbers are 2,3,5 and 2<sup>th</sup>,3<sup>th</sup>and 5<sup>th</sup> prime numbers are 3,5,11.

<h3>C.Beautiful Prime(Hard Version)</h3>
<p>
The problem was set by <a href="https://github.com/mdarikrayhan">Md. Arik Rayhan</a>.The problem is similer to B but the constrains are hard. You need to use bitwise sieve to solve the problem.

<h3>D.Sindbad and Monster</h3>
<p>
The problem was set by <a href="">Tarique Abid</a>.Sindbad and his sailors need to determine if they can stay safe on an island with a specific size, considering tunnels between islands connected by secret doors. To solve this, we perform prime factorization on the island size and calculate the number and sum of divisors. Then, we compare these values with the given constraints. If they meet the criteria and there's no overflow, Sindbad and his sailors can stay safe. The time complexity of the solution is O(q * sqrt(m)), where q is the number of test cases and m is the maximum island size.

<h3>E.Temple Run</h3>
<p>
The problem was set by <a href="">Tarique Abid</a>.To solve this problem, we can use the concept of Euler's Totient Function and GCD Sum. Euler's Totient Function calculates the count of numbers that are coprime with N, where N is the distance of the den from home. This can be precomputed and stored in an array for efficiency. The GCD Sum is the sum of N times the Totient Function value for all divisors of N.
Using the precomputed values of Totient Function and GCD Sum, we can determine if Cinderella can reach her den safely. If the computed GCD Sum value for N is greater than or equal to the total number of obstacles M, it indicates that Cinderella can safely reach her den by transferring obstacles from one segment to another. Otherwise, she won't be able to reach her den safely.

<h3>G.Best Friend Again</h3>
<p>
The problem was set by <a href="https://github.com/MomenulHaque50">Md. Momenul Haque</a>.In this problem the task was to replace the words given word. But you need to be careful while replacing about capitilization. Because the AI can Detect both Momenul and momenul as same. No more hints :-/ .Solution link: <a href="https://github.com/mdarikrayhan/Mind-Strom-4.0-Editorial-and-Problem-Set/tree/main/Solution/7.Best%20Friend%20Again">G.Best Friend Again</a>

<h3>H.CG Code and Life</h3>
<p>
The problem was set by <a href="https://github.com/mdarikrayhan">Md. Arik Rayhan</a>. This was also a giveway problem,Here you just need to find the area of a triangle given it's side. But the sides of the triangle are large so you need to use long double.
